This is a simple CRUD application based on the following course to Udemy - https://www.udemy.com/course/object-oriented-php-mvc/  This version is updated with pagination for the posts, added roles for the users - for the moment they are 2 types (users and admin). Admin can see all users and to edit or delete bad posts. Adde also likes for the posts - like and dislike buttons

THE PROJECT IS STILL IN PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT YET.
